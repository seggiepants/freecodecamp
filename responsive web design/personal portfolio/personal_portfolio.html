        Wishing you could buy Kelp Dip or Bean Lard mulch from the Rejected short, I mocked up what product landing page for Johnson and Mills might look like.

        This started as a halfway mark project for getting halfway through the <a href="exercism.io" alt="exercism.io">Python exercises</a> However, it is also a testbed project to try out new technologies such as test driven development, tkinter, sqlite databases with Create Update Edit and Delete operations used, json parsing, markdown processing, and sphinx documentation generation. The last few aren't in yet but the game is currently playable on python 3.

        I was thinking about making a game programming book when I wrote this and made javascript versions of the sample applications to polish up my Javascript skills.
        Don't worry, I am not about to run off and join a game development company. Games are for after work fun projects.
