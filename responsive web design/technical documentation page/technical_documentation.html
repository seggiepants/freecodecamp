        <h1>The Sierpinski triangle</h1>
        <section id="Introduction" class="main-section">
            <header>Introduction</header>
            <p>The Sierpinski triangle is a common fractal normally in the shape of an equliateral triangle.
                The triangle is made of nested triangles. The triangle is divided up into four smaller triangles.
                The center (upside down triangle) is left empty. The top, left and right triangles are continually
                subdivided in a similar manner.
            </p>
            <p>As a fractal, it is self similar. If you zoom into a section of the fractal it will
                have the same structure and similar appearance to the fractal as a whole. There is 
                no predetermined limit to the detail of the structure. In theory you could zoom in forever. The fractal can be called a level 3 N-Flake, Sieve or a Gasket
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of fractals the structure can be seen elsewhere in mathematics. In particular in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle" target="_blank"></a>Pascal's Triangle</a>. 
                Pascal's triangle begins with a 1. For each subsequent you add new values offset by a half space from the previous row. Each number is the sum of the numbers above and to the right and above and to the left (zero at the edges).
                So the first row is 1, the second is 1,2,1, and the third is 1, 3, 3, 1 and so forth. 
                The strange part is, if you shade in the odd numbered numbers, but not the even ones, it clearly shows the pattern of the Sierpinski triangle.

            </p>
            <p>
                The fractal is even common in pop culture. The TriForce in the &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; is a Sierpinski triangle that has only been subdivided once. 
            </p>
            <p>This is a fractal that can show up when you aren't expecting it.</p>

        <section id="Methods" class="main-section">
            <header>Methods</header>
            <p>We will cover several methods of generating a Sierpinski triangle. 
                These methods include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Manual</li>
                <li>Recursion</li>
                <li>Chaos Game</li>
                <li>L-System</li>
                <li>Arrowhead Curve</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each of these methods will be considered in the following sections.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="Manual" class="main-section">
            <header>Manual</header>
            <p>The Sierpinski triangle is not too complicated to generate manually. You can do this several ways such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Removing triangles</li>
                <li>Shrinking and Duplication</li>
                <li>Combining several triangles together</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When removing triangles you simply subdivide the triangle into four triangles. One upright triangle on each corner with a remaining inverted triangle in the center. At this point you would remove the center by either cutting it out (assuming you were drawing this on paper) or by coloring it in. Then simply repeat the process with the remaining triangles.
                This does present problems when the paper gets too small or for precision cutting/coloring.
            </p>
            <p>Conceptually you can think of the construction as simply shrinking down the original triangle then duplicating it three times and building a new triangle out of that. 
                In fact if you use this method, you can start with an arbitrary shape such as a square a dinosaur or just about anything. It won't matter as the detail will shrink down to a point as you add more revisions. 
                You could do this manually with a photocopier with a reduce function, but the detail will quickly fade with generations.</p>
            </p>
            <p>
                A more fun group project would be to have a large group of people make their own Sierpinski triangle on paper. When complete they can be cut out and 
                arranged into a much larger Sierpinski triangle structure of size only limited by your paper and willpower.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="Recursion" class="main-section">
            <header>Recursion</header>
            <p>Fractals in general are perfect candidate to be plotted by a computer and the Sierpinski triangle is no exception. 
                As a fractal, the method lends itself naturally to recursion where a function can call itself an arbitrary number of 
                times (potentially infinitely).</p>
            <p>Below is a sample implementation of the Sierpinski triangle using recursion and the turtle graphics library in <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
import turtle
import math

def drawTriangle(x, y, size, iterations):
    angle = math.pi / 3.0 # 60 degrees

    if (size &lt;= 3 or iterations &lt;= 0):
        turtle.penup()
        turtle.setpos(x, y)
        turtle.pendown()

        turtle.setpos(x + (size * math.cos(angle)), y + (size * math.sin(angle)))
        turtle.setpos(x + size, y)
        turtle.setpos(x, y)
    else:
        drawTriangle(x, y, size / 2, iterations - 1)
        drawTriangle(x + (size / 2), y, (size / 2), iterations - 1)
        drawTriangle((x + (size / 2) * math.cos(angle)), (y + (size / 2) * math.sin(angle)), (size / 2), iterations - 1)

size = min(turtle.window_width(), turtle.window_height())
size = int(7 * size / 8)

turtle.speed('fastest')
turtle.tracer(0, 0)
turtle.hideturtle()
drawTriangle(int(-size / 2), int(-size / 2), size, 7)
turtle.update()                
            </code></pre>
            <figure>
            <canvas id = "recursive" width = "300" height ="300"></canvas>
            <figcaption>Sierpinski Triangle generated recursively</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>In this code the drawTriangle() function does the actual work 
            and the rest of the script is setup and calling the function. The 
            drawTriangle function first checks if we have a triangle that is 
            too small to subdivide further or if we have reached the maximum
            limit for subdividing the triangle. This check is required to keep 
            the function from looping forever. If we meet the condition we simply draw 
            the current triangle.
            </p><p>
            If you haven't reached the limit however, the function instead makes
            three more calls to the drawTriangle function. One each for the 
            bottom left, bottom right, and top sections. If you are comfortable 
            with recursion this code should be fairly simple.
            </p>

        <section id="Chaos_Game" class="main-section">
            <header>Chaos Game</header>
            <p>Generating the Sierpinski triangle using the chaos game is somewhat strange. Instead of drawing triangles, you draw random points in the triangle.</p>
            <p>First you choose a random point in the triangle and a randome corner. Then plot the point and use that point for the next point to 
                plot. From there you choose a random corner and go halfway between the previous point and the corner of the triangle.
                If you do it enough times, the Sierpinski triangle emerges.
            </p>
            <p>Much like the previous method, below is some python code to generate the triangle as well as a javascript canvas to show off how it runs.</p>

            <header>Lindemayer Systems</header>
            <p>Lindemayer Systems of L-Systems is a string rewriting method for generating fractal like images. You start with an Axiom, or base case for the string.
                From the axiom or previous generation's output you iterate over the string. If the character matches one of the rules, you replace that character with the new value in the next generation string.</p>
            <p>After this all that is left is to map the rules in the string to a step in drawing the output. The step can be something like moving forward or backward or changing the orientation of a virtual turtle.</p>
            <p>Lindemayer systems are especially good a generating plant or algae type images. We will look at two Lindemayer Systems</p>

            <p>The Sierpenski triangle has several related fractals. The most common is the Sierpenski Carpet. Instead of operating 
                on a triangle you operate on a square cut into a 3x3 grid. You remove the center piece and begin iterating just like the Sierpinski triangle.

            <p>If you go into 3D you can find the menger sponge, Sierpenski cube, or the Sierpenski pyramid.</p>
            <p>There are even fractals that degenerate into a Sierpenski triangle if you change some of the conditions.
                Below is a Sierpenski triangle. However, if you reduce the angle that the branches are drawn at it changes from 
                a triangle to a tree.

            <p>The Sierpenski triangle is one of the most common fractals you may encounter. In fact if you are tying to make a generative drawing you may create it or something similar by accident.
                It is certainly a fractal worth looking into.
