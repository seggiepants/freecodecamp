      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kirby" id="tribute-link" target="_blank">Jack Kirby</a> was a prolific comic book artist. Largely rememberd for his famous work at both Marvel and DC Comics.
    </p><p>
    Chances are that most of the comic superhero and supervillan characters you have heard of were thanks to him. Some of his creations include:
    <ul>
      <li>Captain America</li>
      <li>The Fantastic Four</li>
      <li>The X-Men (Professor X, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Ice Man, Angel, Beast, Magneto)</li>
      <li>The Hulk</li>
      <li>Iron Man</li>
      <li>Thor (Marvel)</li>
      <li>Doctor Doom</li>
      <li>The Silver Surfer</li>
      <li>Galactus</li>
      <li>The Inhumans</li>
      <li>Black Panter</li>
      <li>Celestials</li>
      <li>The Fourth World / New Gods (Darkseid)</li>
      <li>Mister Miracle</li>
      <li>OMAC</li>
      <li>Kamandi</li>
      <li>The Demon</li>
    </ul>
    </p><p>
    His collaborations with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_lee" target="_blank">Stan &quot;The Man&quot; Lee</a> revolutionized the comic industry in the 60's. Despite his prolific output he constantly had misgivings about how he was treated, specifically due to character ownership rights and poor pay. He had to fight a legal battle to even get his original art returned that was owed to him.
    </p><p>
    His artistic style was dynamic and bold. It quickly became the &quot;house&quot; style for Marvel Comics. His <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby_krackle">Kirby Krackle</a> technique is a well known example.
